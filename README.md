## very much a work in progress
I haven't even converted the crate from a binary one to library yet.

# spotifry
An **idiomatic** rust client for the Spotify web API!

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute, mostly by adding `Object`s from the [API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#objects-index), removing `Option`s if they are unnecesary, and anything else you think would benefit.
